Astro::SkyCat
-------------

A perl interface to the ESO (European Southern Observatory) SkyCat library.
The SkyCat library is used to access astronomical catalogues and image
servers across the internet.

This is currently in proof of concept stage. Simple things work but the
perl interface may change.

Requirements
------------

- The catlib library itself. Available from 
   ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/archive/skycat/README.html
  The higher level SkyCat libraries are not required.

- This module uses the C++ interface to CatLib so you will need
  a C++ compiler

Building
--------

Currently the Makefile.PL file must be edited manually to
reflect the location of the catlib libraries and the
name of the C++ compiler to be used on your system.

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

There are currently no tests.

Documentation
-------------

The catlib library is documented at http://archive.eso.org/skycat/docs/cat/

The perl interface attempts to match the C++ interface as much as possible.
See the module documentation for more information.

Platforms
---------

The module has only been tested under linux.
